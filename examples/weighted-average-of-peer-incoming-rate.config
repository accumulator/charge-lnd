# Use the weighted average of the peer node's channels inbound rate.
# Example:
#    - Let's suppose you have a channel with Peer XYZ.
#    - Peer XYZ has 4 channels.
#    - Those 4 channels are 1M, 2M, 3M, and 4M sats capacity.
#    - The inbound fee rates for those channels are 100 ppm, 200 ppm,
#      300 ppm, and 400 ppm.
#    - The weighted average is the sum of fees multiplied by the
#      channel's capacity. In this case, 300 ppm. Note, it's higher
#      than the plain average, because more capacity is at the 400 ppm
#      rate compared to the lower ppm rate.
#
# The inbound_weighted_average_fee_rate_premium_percent value adds a
# multiple of the weighted average fee. For example, a value of 25
# means that a 200 ppm weighted average will be set to 250 ppm.
